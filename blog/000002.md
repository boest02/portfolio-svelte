# The Hidden Costs of Overloading Your Project with NPM Packages

## Introduction
- NPM makes it incredibly easy to install third-party packages, but at what cost?
- Many projects end up bloated with dependencies, leading to security risks, and performance issues.
- These dependencies can lead to many headaches when trying to bring your projects up to date (Tech Debt).
- In this post, we’ll explore the hidden costs of relying too much on NPM packages and how to manage dependencies wisely.

---

## Dependency Bloat & Performance Impact
- Every package added increases bundle size, slowing down load times.
- Example: A small utility function might pull in an entire library when native JavaScript could do the job.


## Security Risks & Vulnerabilities
- Many NPM packages are outdated or have known security flaws.
- Example: *Left-pad* and *event-stream* incidents (high-profile package issues).
- Running `*npm audit*` to identify vulnerabilities.
- Regularly checking for **CVEs** (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).

## Maintaining Technical Debt
- Dependencies can become unsupported or introduce breaking changes.
- Example: A package that hasn’t been updated in years may cause issues when Node.js updates.
- Keeping up with updates is time-consuming, but necessary to avoid compatibility issues.
- Use `*npm outdated*` to see what you're dealing with.

Sample `*npm outdated*' on an older project

```bash
Package                         Current   Wanted   Latest
@babel/core                      7.24.0   7.24.9   7.26.7
@eslint/js                        9.2.0    9.2.0   9.19.0
@rollup/plugin-commonjs          25.0.7   25.0.8   28.0.2
@rollup/plugin-node-resolve      15.2.3   15.2.4   16.0.0
@stylistic/stylelint-plugin       2.1.0    2.1.3    3.1.1
autoprefixer                    10.4.18  10.4.20  10.4.20
cssnano                           6.1.0    6.1.2    7.0.6
eslint                            9.2.0    9.2.0   9.19.0
globals                          15.1.0   15.1.0  15.14.0

sass                             1.72.0   1.72.0   1.83.4
stylelint                        16.2.1   16.2.1  16.14.1
stylelint-config-standard-scss   13.0.0   13.0.0   14.0.0
```

## Strategies for Smarter Package Management

- **Use Official & Well-Maintained Libraries** – Prefer packages backed by major companies or strong communities.
- **Evaluate If a Package Is Necessary** – Ask: *Can this be done with native JS?*
- **Regularly Audit & Remove Unused Packages** – Use `*npm prune*` or `*depcheck*`.
- **Write Your Own Utility Functions When Feasible** – Sometimes, a simple function is better than adding a new dependency.


## Conclusion
- NPM packages can save time, but excessive or careless use can lead to long-term problems.
- Be mindful of what you install—less is often more in frontend development.
- Regularly review and optimize your dependencies to keep your project lean, secure, and maintainable.
