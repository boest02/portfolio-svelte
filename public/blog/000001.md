# Vanilla CSS vs Tailwind CSS

As Tailwind CSS continues to dominate web styling and gains popularity with AI tools that can automatically generate Tailwind classes, I see some potential concerns with this approach. One of my main issues with Tailwind is the difficulty in debugging CSS through browser developer tools, particularly when troubleshooting layout or styling problems.

When inspecting elements in devtools, you're often confronted with what I'd call "class soup" - a long string of utility classes that can be hard to parse. These classes need to be applied to each element in the DOM tree that requires styling, which can make the markup quite verbose. This model can also be harder to maintain over time since you have to go to each element in the markup to adust things like font-weight or padding, etc.

Searching for an example I found a small "card" component on the Walmart website that uses Tailwind CSS to take some fairly simple markup as follows...

```html
<div class="card-wrapper w-100 aspect-ratio br3 mt4-xl mt3  aspect-ratio--gpov-m">
    <div class="aspect-ratio--object br3 flex pv3 pv4-xl overflow-hidden z-0 justify-start items-start">
        <div class="w-100 absolute absolute--fill br3 overflow-hidden" style="background-color:#FFFFFF">
            <img loading="lazy" class="w-100 absolute absolute--fill" width="auto" height="auto" >
            </div>
            <section class="flex flex-wrap w-60 justify-start items-start pl3 pl4-xl z-0 mw-calc">
                <p class="b f4 f5-l f4-hdkp f3-xl f22-xxl f2-rdxl f1-rdxxl lh-title lh-11-l lh-105-rdxl ma0 w-100" style="color: rgb(0, 30, 96);">The sweetest styles</p>
                <a class="z-2 nowrap link mt3-xl mt2 mr3-xl mr2 underline no-underline-hover h-auto pa0 f6 f6-rdxl" style="color: rgb(0, 30, 96);">
                    <span>Shop fashion</span>
                </a>
            </section>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

The markup with the Tailwind classes and some inline styles produces the following "card" type element on the page.  The classes you can see are on the parent and each child in this tree, which can make it hard to maintain and debug. (_I've stripped out most of the other element attributes except the classes and inline styles to focus on the styling_)

If we strip this same markup of all the Tailwind clases and prep it for using vanilla CSS to style it it looks something like this, which to me is more concise...

```html
<div class="card-wrapper">
    <div>
        <div>
            <img loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" >
            </div>
            <section>
                <p>The sweetest styles</p>
                <a>
                    <span>Shop fashion</span>
                </a>
            </section>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

Now the CSS can be deployed as part of a component or in a larger stylesheet to style this "card" element. I've created a version of what this might look like below, which I feel is more maintainable and easier to debug in the devtools. This is currently minus any mobile specific styles and I did not bring over the exact fonts for brevity. Although the mobile styles can also be cleanly grouped in media queries for easier debugging as well.

```css
.card-wrapper {
    position: relative;
    border-radius: .5rem;
    overflow: hidden;
    margin: 10px auto;
    div {
        & > section {
            position: absolute;
            padding: 20px;
            top: 20px;
            left: 20px;
            color: rgb(0, 30, 96);
            width: 50%;
            p {
                font-size: 1.5rem;
                font-weight: bolder;
                line-height: 1;
                padding-bottom: 30px;
            }
            a {
                font-size: 1rem;
                font-weight: 400;
                text-decoration: underline;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And this is how the markup renders, styled with the vanilla CSS...

While Tailwind is a powerful tool, I believe that developers with strong CSS expertise can benefit from writing vanilla CSS for better debugging capabilities. When troubleshooting production issues—such as style leakage or broken layouts—clear, semantic CSS makes it much easier to identify and fix problems compared to sifting through utility classes. Additionally, adjustments to properties like font weights or padding can be managed centrally, improving maintainability.

That said, Tailwind excels in rapid development and enforcing consistency through utility classes, making it a valuable tool in the right situations. However, there are cases where vanilla CSS can be the better choice when applied correctly. Ultimately, the key is to adopt a consistent, well-documented approach that your team can maintain effectively over time.
